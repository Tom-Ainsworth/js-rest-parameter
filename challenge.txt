Advanced JavaScript - The rest parameter
When learning about rest operator you were taught it is used when you could expect an unknown quantity of values being passed into a function when it is called. In this challenge, you will get to use the rest operator and also an arrow function and the spread operator.
 
In particular, you will:
Work with the rest operator.
spread operator
Arrow functions
Log values to the terminal
Result
Your result should look like the image below.

['b', 'd', 'a', 'c', 'f', 'e', 'h', 'k', 'g', 'j', 'i', 'l']
['o', 'n', 'm', 'l', 'k', 'j', 'i', 'h', 'g', 'f', 'e', 'd', 'c', 'b', 'a']
[ 'b', 'd', 'a', 'c', 'f', 'e' ]


Steps
You will assign an array to a variable which will contain a copy of the array mixedLetters and 6 other letters.
You will create an arrow function which should take two parameters. This function should combine all the argument passed in into a single array and sort them and reverse them and then return this array
You are free to choose an arrow function of your choice to do this.
Within the function body, you are free to create the array any way you want, but try to look out for opportunities to use what you have been learning in the advanced JavaScript material.

1. Create a variable named: moreMixedLetters using the keyword let
2. Assign an array to the variable moreMixedLetters which should be a copy of the array mixedLetters and then the following values: 'h', 'k', 'g', 'j', 'i', 'l'  (note steps 1 and 2 should be done on a single line)
3. log out moreMixedLetters
4. Create a variable named: updateSortReverse using the keyword const
5. Assign the variable updateSortReverse an arrow function 
6. The arrow function should take two parameters one named: arr and another named: letters which should use the rest parameter syntax 
7. This arrow function should combine all the argument passed in into a single array and sort them and reverse them and then return this array
8. Create a variable named reverseSort using the keyword let
9. Variable reverseSort should be assigned the return value from calling the updateSortReverse function passing in the moreMixedLetters array and the string values: 'n', 'm', 'o'
10 log out the variable reverseSort to see its value
11. log out the variable mixedLetters to see that it has not been changed if you have done everything correctly
